## Overview

DeepFake creation is a recently popular concept as publicly available advanced techniques such as Autoencoders and GANs emerge. The project targets construction of a deepfake detection system that will effectively and efficiently detect deepfakes which pose a huge threat for personal identity and privacy.



Our most sincere thanks to dear professor İnci Meliha Baytaş for never ending support, inspiration, and motivation.
