# Files Structures
  - There need to be a directory called `My_Files` in the directory where `main.py` is located.
  - Senders must place their files that they want to share with receiver in the `My_Files` and receivers can see the downloaded files in this directory after the downloading has been completed.


# Requirements:
  - The program has been written in Python 3.
  - We have tested this program in Ubuntu. 
  - We tested this program with .txt and .jpg file extensions.
  - Maximum size of file we have tried to download is 1.6 MB.
  - The buffer size is 4 MB.

# Important:
- The program is designed as multiple user torrent system.
- User can download chunks of a file from multiple seeds.


### Run the program:
- Enter the following command in terminal:

```sh
$ python3 main.py 
```

### Finalize the program:
- You just press 7 to quit or you can just CRTL + C to quit. It will finalize all the processes.
