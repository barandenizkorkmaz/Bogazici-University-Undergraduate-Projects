Any customer who reaches the timeout will be dropped and added to unsatisfied customer list.\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "The collection of statistics leads us into the derivation of results by observing the data. For both sizes, we observe that the utilization of system servers are nearly the same. The average waiting times also remain unchanged, except a minor decrease in maximum total waiting time to total system time ratio. Plus, we see that there exists a linear relationship by the factor of 5 between the system size and the average number of people waiting to be served and unsatisfied customers. We can conclude that as the system size grows, the long-run measures related to taking the average show a linear growth as well, while utilization measures remain unchanged. This implies that the system size has nearly no effect in system performance.\n"
