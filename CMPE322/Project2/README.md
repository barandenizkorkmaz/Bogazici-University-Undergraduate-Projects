### How to run:
```bash
# Use 'main' command to create executable 'simulation'
mpic++ main.cpp -o main

# A compiled program 'simulation', can be run with the following:
./simulation [input.txt]

#[input.txt]: The input file.
#Please ensure that the input file is in .txt format. The program will create the output file named 'input_log.txt' automatically. You can use testcases given in the folder.
```
